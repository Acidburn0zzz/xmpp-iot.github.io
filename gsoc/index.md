The XMPP community is part of the Google summer of Code 2015 and for XMPP-IoT we have two projects that can be of interest [prototyping tools with python and javascript](http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Summer_of_Code_2015#Prototyping_tools.2C_for_Internet_of_Things_Using_SleekXMPP_and_Web)
[Adding XMPP-iot to opent](http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Summer_of_Code_2015#Adding_XMPP-IoT_to_the_openHAB_smarthome_project_using_Smack)

#What is XMPP-IoT
This site tries to be the answer for the question please help out by forking the repository and help in making this site as descriptive as you would like it to be. 



#Talk to us!

We'd really like to talk with you a bit, so please come by the XSF's GSoC MUC room at gsoc@muc.xmpp.org and have a chat - we like to know the people we're thinking about working with for the summer (please be aware that issues with Google Talk's XMPP server means it's not usually usable for joining MUC rooms). 

#Teaser task for prototyping tools

The idea of XMPP started long time ago around 2002 when there was an increasing
number of instant messaging clients that couldn't talk to
eachother. You needed many many accounts and there was always
functionallity differenses.

The same problem is now arising with the Internet of Things. There is
so many different cloud systems talking care of things for
you. XMPP-IoT provides means for all these systems and individual
devices to collaborate just as you and I can be friends and start
chatting.

#Teaser task for openHAB

The extensions created on top of the XMPP protocol all solves
different usecases. Read, Write, consume 

This is a github based open site connected to the
