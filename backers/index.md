# Manifest
By signing this page. We as an individual or organisation truly believe in this.

- Internet of Things standardisation in an open process is good
- Collaboration between companies should use encryption
- Sessions from clients to servers should likewise use good encryption
- Authentication and authorisation of access should be used and enforced on different levels
