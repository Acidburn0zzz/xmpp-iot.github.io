The idea of XMPP started long time ago around 2002 when there was an increasing
number of instant messaging clients that couldn't talk to
eachother. You needed many many accounts and there was always
functionallity differenses.

The same problem is now arising with the Internet of Things. There is
so many different cloud systems talking care of things for
you. XMPP-IoT provides means for all these systems and individual
devices to collaborate just as you and I can be friends and start
chatting.

The extensions created on top of the XMPP protocol all solves
different usecases. Read, Write, consume
