#Objective

#### Identifying Devices and Extending Client to all WebPages

##Abstract

ConverseJs is a Chat Client that uses XMPP standards. We need to extend its support to [XEP-0323](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0323.html) and [XEP-0325](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0325.html) standards, so that the client can distinguish between friends and devices.

##Work

* Extended Chat Client to all Pages.
* Instantiated our own BOSH Server at 'http://jabber.sust.se/xmpp-httpbind/'.
* Made a Script that uses XEP-0323 and XEP-0325 to distinguish between devices by sending a Disco Query.
* This is the Sequence Diagram for a Successful IoT-Sensor Data Request.

##Road Ahead

* Set up a Different Tab for Devices which can read and write values to it.
* Creating IoT Device APIs for Devices like intel edison, intel galileo, raspberry PI 2, beagle bone black, etc.
