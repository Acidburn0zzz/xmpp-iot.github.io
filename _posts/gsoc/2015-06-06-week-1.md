#Objective

#### Create an Interactive user interface for Web Visualisation Client

##Abstract

For the devices to interact with our website we need a chat client that uses XMPP Protocol.

##Work

* Used Converse.js to implement a single page Chat Client on the homepage of [XMPP-IoT](http://xmpp-iot.org/) Website.
* We have used the official [Jappix binding (or BOSH) server](https://bind.jappix.com/).

##Road Ahead

* Extend Chat Client to all Pages.
* Instantiate our own BOSH Server.
* Differentiate between Friends and Devices.
